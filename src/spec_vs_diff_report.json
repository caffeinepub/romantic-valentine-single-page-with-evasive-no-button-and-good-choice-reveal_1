      "requirement": "In the final step of the bottom \"OneMoreThingInteraction\" reveal (after the third click), display the user-provided uploaded image (original filename: \"627674318_941888025190821_1390922055753035112_n.jpg\") by ensuring the correct file exists under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` with a clean stable filename and that `frontend/src/components/OneMoreThingInteraction.tsx` references that exact public URL.",
      "reason": "The diff shows no changes to `frontend/src/components/OneMoreThingInteraction.tsx` and no added/modified files under `frontend/public/assets/generated/`. Therefore the final reveal image source cannot have been updated to the required `/assets/generated/...` static asset URL.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest asks to update the final reveal image by adding a static asset and referencing it from `OneMoreThingInteraction.tsx`. The diff only changes `project_state.json`, which is not part of the requested implementation.",
