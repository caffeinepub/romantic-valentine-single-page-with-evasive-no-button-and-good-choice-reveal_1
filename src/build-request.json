        "The image is served as a static asset from `frontend/public/assets/generated/` and referenced via a `/assets/generated/...` URL (no backend image serving).",
        "The image renders correctly in Chrome on Windows and still uses appropriate sizing (e.g., contained with a max height) and rounded corners consistent with the current theme.",
